Your head is pounding. You wake up in a large unfamiliar foyer, completely alone. There is a bench, a chest, and a candle. This person has a strange design sense. Did you really drink that much last night? Slowly you realize that this was not simply a drunk night. You look down at yourself in the dim light and see traces of dried blood. You were in a fight, but when? Where? You decide to stand up and create a plan to get out of this place.

The door opens to an eerie scene. A large open graveyard, with a light layer of fog covering the ground. You sprint out of the conservatory into the graveyard.

Now time to sue this place, you didn't sign up for this realistic of an escape room. You had 17 moves left.
